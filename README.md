# MuseMind — AI Poem Generator
*Week 2 Project - Your First Generative AI App - AI Content Generator*

MuseMind is an AI-powered web app that transforms your feelings, emotions, and mood into personalised poems. Choose a theme, type your prompt, and let AI weave your words into art that captures how you feel and thoughtfully espresses it.


## Why We Created MuseMind
Have you ever felt something deeply but could not find the words to express it? That’s where MuseMind fits in, in the quiet spaces between emotion and language.  

We wanted to build something that does not just generate text, but **transforms feeling into form**. MuseMind explores how AI can become a creative partner, helping anyone find the words to give what is in their heart artistic shape through language.


## How MuseMind Works

1. The user selects a theme (LoveLines, SoulScript, or MoodVerse).  
2. The user is redirected to the page where the poem will be generated and has to type an idea, emotion, or thought into the input field.  
3. MuseMind combines a fixed prompt template with user input.  
4. The backend sends this prompt to Hugging Face’s API.  
5. The AI returns a unique and beautiful poem matching the chosen theme and feelings.
