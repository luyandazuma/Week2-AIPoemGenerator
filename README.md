# MuseMind — AI Poem Generator
<h3>Your Mood. Our Muse.</h3>

MuseMind is an AI-powered web application that transforms your feelings, emotions, and mood into personalised poems. Choose a theme, type your prompt, and let AI weave your words into art that captures how you feel and thoughtfully expresses it.


## 💡 Why We Created MuseMind

Have you ever felt something deeply but could not find the words to express it? That’s where MuseMind fits in, in the quiet spaces between emotion and language.  

We wanted to build something that does not just generate text, but **transforms feeling into form**. MuseMind explores how AI can become a creative partner, helping anyone find the words to give what is in their heart artistic shape through language.

## 🎨 Features

Three Themes. One Custom Creation:
- 💕 LoveLines
- 🎨 MoodVerse
- 🌟 SoulScript   

AI-Powered Generation - Utilises Google Gemini API for intelligent, contextual poem creation.  
Real-time Generation - Watch your poem appear with smooth typewriter animation.  
Beautiful Themed UI - Each theme has its own unique visual aesthetic.  
Responsive Design - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  


## ⚙ How MuseMind Works

1. User selects a theme (LoveLines, SoulScript, or MoodVerse).  
2. User is redirected to the page where the poem will be generated and has to type an idea, emotion, or thought into the input field.  
3. MuseMind combines a fixed prompt template with user input.  
4. The backend sends this prompt to Gemini’s API.  
5. The AI returns a unique and beautiful poem matching the chosen theme and feelings.
6. Users can regenerate another poem by clicking the "Generate" button again.


## 💌 Themes

| Theme | Description | Tone |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **LoveLines** (Pinks, roses and whites) | Heartfelt poems for loved ones. |  Romantic, emotional, and warm. |
| **MoodVerse** (Neon pinks, cyans, deep purples) | Expressive poems based on your current feelings or mood. | Emotive and expressive. 
| **SoulScript** (Purples, muted tones and background) | Affirming and kind words to positively influence one's sense of self. | Assuring, uplifting and gentle. |
